# UI IV - Ex 3 - Design screens

**Instructions:**

Based on the wireframes and your design system library, take your mid-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity level!

Select 5 screens that will show the user flow of a customer who: 

- arrives on the homepage
- browses the content
- checks one product page
- adds the product to the cart
- checks out

Use your components, call to actions and visuals to complete the wireframes. 

**Deliverables:** 

- 5 high-fidelity screens from Figma
- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on canva.com but don’t overload your design with too much details!
