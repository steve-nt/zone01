# UX VII - Ex 7 - Test

**Instructions:** 

Prepare a testing protocol and run it!

**Deliverables:** 

- A testing protocol script
- Photos from the tests
- Key learnings from the tests (5 tests are required)
- Key learnings from this phase
- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”.  For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on canva.com but don’t overload your design with too much details!
