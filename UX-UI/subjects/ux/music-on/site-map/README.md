# UX V - Ex 2 - Site map

**Instructions:** 

Stick to the website you have chosen in Ex.1 and design a site map. The site map should include all the pages of the website as well as the connections and hierarchy. 

**List of websites:** 

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- More... as long as it is a South American music label ;-)

**Deliverables:** 

- A PDF page of the site map.
- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on canva.com but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Tips:** 

- Start by drawing on paper, then pass it on to a digital tool.
- Please label your document! Title and name of the website.
