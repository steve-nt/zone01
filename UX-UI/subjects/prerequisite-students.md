Here are some insights about the program: 

1. As a student, you are invited to send your documents by pushing them on GIthub. 

2. One of the main tools that is used in design is Figma. Ask a student certificate at the school administration services and enjoy a free plan as a student through this page: https://www.figma.com/education/students/

3. In some UX exercises, you will be invited to go outside the building and talk to people in the street. Get in touch with the school administration services to make sure your age is sufficient with the school rules. 

4. The projects are supposed to be done after the UX quest and the UI quest. Each project is divided in two parts, one that is focused on UX and one that is focused on UI. At the end of each part, you are supposed to show your work in front of an audience of at least 5 people who will be invited to give you feedback.
